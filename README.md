## User Experience UX

The Football Quiz is designed to provide users with a smooth, interactive, and engaging quiz experience centered around football knowledge. Here is how the users interact with the game:

- __Welcome & Start__

  - Upon visiting the page, users are welcomed with a friendly greeting and a Start Quiz button.
    I used clean and centered layout to draw immediate attention to the quiz without distractions.

- __Quiz Flow__

  - The quiz presents one question at a time to avoid overwhelming users.
  - A 15-second countdown timer adds excitement and encourages quick thinking.
  - Users choose from four options per question, and the correct answer is highlighted after selection, providing instant 
    feedback.
    

- __Visual Feedback__

  - Answers are color-coded:
    Green for correct answers
    Red for incorrect answers

## Testing

- __HTML validator__

The HTML for this project was validated using the Nu HTML Checker. The validation was performed by submitting the deployed site URL: https://parre87.github.io/projekt2/. The checker reported one warning (see picture below).

This warning indicates a structural issue that could affect accessibility or SEO. To resolve the issue is to add a meaningful content inside the heading or removing the empty tag.
